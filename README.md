# Testing Cloudflare and Alchemy

This repo showcases an simple website deployed on [Cloudflare](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) with [Alchemy](https://github.com/sam-goodwin/alchemy). It also showcases a simple platform with an API to manage Organizations and Users. A custom resource in Alchemy is generated by [CursorAI](https://www.cursor.com/), and used as part of the website's Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the "platform" by following [this guide](/platform/README.md) or simply click:
   
   [![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/markjmiller/cloudflare-alchemy/tree/main/platform)

2. Deploy the "website" and IaC resources by running these in the [website directory](/website/):

   ```bash
   npm install && npm run deploy
   ```

That's it! Alchemy should have successfully created the website and provisioned resources from the platform.

## IaC

IaC is managed with Alchemy in [this file](/website/alchemy.run.ts).

TODO: create [custom resource](https://alchemy.run/docs/guides/custom-resources.html).

Prompt (replace `REPLACE_ME` with your own workers.dev subdomain):
> Create a Resource for managing a User. See: https://example-platform.REPLACE_ME.workers.dev/docs/api
